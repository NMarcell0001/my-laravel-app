Security assignment nr. 3:

Admin user credentials:

asd@gmail.com <- email
12345678 <- password

After logging in, you can check the "Articles" page. There, you can test basic CRUD operations. 
If you log out and register (then log in) with a non-admin user (Anything except asd@gmail.com) 
then you wont be able to see the crud buttons and wont be able to access those routes either.
(Only index and show)
